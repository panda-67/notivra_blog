## Building Post–Flash Flood Questionnaires with R

Flash floods are not merely hydrological events. They represent a collapse of
social systems: homes destroyed, livelihoods lost, and security eroded. Yet many
post-disaster studies fail to capture this reality—not due to lack of data, but
because of **weak instruments from the outset**.

This article, prepared for Notivra Insight, provides a comprehensive guide to
**pre-survey design and validation of new questionnaires**, using **R as the
primary analytical tool**.

## Why Pre-Surveys Are Non-Negotiable

A pre-survey is not administrative ritual. It is an epistemic filter. Its
purposes are limited and precise:

1. To test whether items are understood as intended  
2. To verify that constructs have a defensible structure  
3. To eliminate flawed items before the main survey  

Skipping this step undermines the entire research process.

## Common Failures in Post-Disaster Research

Recurring methodological errors include:

- Proceeding directly to the main survey  
- Treating Cronbach’s alpha as sufficient validation  
- Ignoring factor analysis  
- Retaining items for sentimental reasons  

These are not minor flaws—they are design failures.

## What Does “Validity” Really Mean?

There is no such thing as a “correct” questionnaire, only:

- **Validity**: does it measure the intended construct?  
- **Reliability**: does it measure consistently?  

For newly developed post-flood instruments, **construct validity** is critical
and must be tested through **Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)**.

## Why Use R?

R offers clear advantages:

- Full transparency  
- Reproducibility  
- Acceptance in peer-reviewed journals  
- Seamless transition to advanced models  

R forces structural thinking, not button-clicking.

## A Proper Pre-Survey Workflow

1. Theory-driven item construction  
2. Pre-survey (30–100 respondents)  
3. Data cleaning  
4. KMO and Bartlett’s tests  
5. Exploratory Factor Analysis  
6. Item elimination  
7. Reliability testing per construct  

The outcome is a lean, valid, and defensible instrument.

## Why EFA Cannot Be Skipped

Flash flood impacts are context-specific. Construct structures cannot be
assumed. EFA tests whether respondents interpret items as researchers intend.

Without EFA, research relies on hope rather than evidence.

---

## Essential Pre-Survey Outputs

A legitimate pre-survey must report:

- KMO and Bartlett statistics  
- Final factor structure  
- Factor loading tables  
- Cronbach’s alpha per construct  
- Justification for discarded items  

This is the foundation of credible research.

## Closing Note

Weak instruments lead to misleading conclusions and flawed policy.  
A rigorous pre-survey is unforgiving—but scientific integrity demands it.

**At Notivra Insight, we believe strong data are born from instruments willing
to be tested, broken, and refined.**
