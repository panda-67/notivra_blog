Forests whisper in code — DNA sequences that trace ancestry, migration, and survival. **Biopython** lets us read that whisper.

In this post, we show you how to:

- Parse FASTA/GenBank data for rare forest plants,
- Align sequences to study genetic drift,
- Visualize molecular variation with matplotlib.

> “Coding for conservation” isn’t just a slogan — it’s a survival strategy. Let’s decode the future, one gene at a time.
