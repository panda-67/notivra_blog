# Data as Objects, Analysis as Transformation

> In R, you don’t command the data — you *transform* it.

Every R session is a living stream. Data flows in, and with each pipe, it changes shape — cleaner, clearer, closer to insight.  
That is the essence of R: **data as objects, analysis as transformation**.

---

## 🧩 Seeing Data as Objects

Everything in R is an object — data frames, vectors, lists, models.  
You don’t just run commands; you **manipulate structures**.  
This object orientation makes R a consistent and expressive tool.

```r
# A tibble is more than a table — it’s an object with behavior
library(tibble)

df <- tibble(
  species = c("Elephant", "Tiger", "Turtle"),
  weight_kg = c(5400, 220, 90)
)

print(df)
```

Each column is a vector, each row a moment in your data’s story.

## 🔄 The Pipe: The Language of Flow

The pipe (`|>`, or `%>%` from `magrittr`) changed everything.  
Instead of nesting functions, you **think in transformations** — one step flows into the next.

```r
library(dplyr)

df |>
  mutate(weight_ton = weight_kg / 1000) |>
  filter(weight_ton > 0.1) |>
  arrange(desc(weight_ton))
```

Each line reads like a sentence: “Take the data, then mutate, then filter, then arrange.”  
It’s not programming — it’s **thought in motion**.

---

## 🧠 Transformation as Understanding

Transformation is not just cleaning — it’s **modeling your mental structure of reality**.  
When you reshape a dataset, you’re deciding what matters, what disappears, and what stays visible.  
In this way, analysis becomes an act of **philosophy**: how you choose to see the world.

---

## 💡 Reflection

> What does your pipeline say about how you think?

Try this:

```r
library(dplyr)
starwars |>
  select(name, species, height, mass, homeworld) |>
  mutate(bmi = mass / (height/100)^2) |>
  arrange(desc(bmi)) |>
  head(5)
```

This is not just code — it’s a thought process, rendered in syntax.

### 📘 Try It Yourself

1. Take any dataset from `datasets::`
2. Apply at least three transformations using the pipe
3. Observe how your mental model of the data changes
