# The Reproducible Scientist

> If your science can’t be repeated, it’s not science — it’s a story that can’t be told again.

Every R user eventually faces the same haunting truth: our scripts sprawl, our data scatter, and our insights vanish in half-finished notebooks.  
Reproducibility is not a luxury — it’s the oxygen of modern data work.

## 🗂 The Anatomy of a Reproducible Project

Order is not bureaucracy. It’s mercy for your future self.
A clean project structure turns chaos into clarity:

```
my-project/
├── data/
│   ├── raw/
│   └── processed/
├── R/
│   ├── functions.R
│   └── analysis.R
├── outputs/
│   ├── figures/
│   └── reports/
├── README.md
└── my-project.Rproj
```

This is your lab bench — every tool, every specimen in its place.

## 📄 The Power of R Markdown and Quarto

Reproducibility isn’t just about code — it’s **about narrative**.

```r
---
title: "Elephant Weight Study"
author: "Notivra Team"
output: html_document
---

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(df, aes(weight_kg)) + geom_histogram()
```

In this single file, code and reasoning live together — no more _“forgot which script produced this figure.”_  
**R Markdown and Quarto** turn analysis into an essay: human-readable, machine-executable.

---

## 🧮 Version Control as Memory

Git is not only for programmers. It’s for _scientists with memory loss_.

- `git init` — start your timeline.  
- `git commit -m "added data cleaning script"` — freeze a moment.  
- `git diff` — watch how your thinking evolved.  

Each commit is a fossil record of your intellect.

---

## 🔁 From Projects to Pipelines

As your work grows, reproducibility means automation.
Tools like `targets` or `drake` let you define **what depends on what**, and rebuild only what changes.

```r
library(targets)

tar_pipeline(
  tar_target(raw_data, read.csv("data/raw/field.csv")),
  tar_target(clean_data, clean(raw_data)),
  tar_target(summary, summarize(clean_data))
)
```

Now your analysis isn’t a one-off — it’s a **machine of truth**.

## 🧠 Reflection

> What would happen if someone reran your project a year from now?  
> Would they get the same story?

---

### 📘 Try It Yourself

1. Create a new RStudio Project.  
2. Organize it with `data/`, `R/`, and `outputs/`.  
3. Write your analysis in an R Markdown file.  
4. Save your first commit with Git.  

You’ve just taken your first step from chaos to clarity.
