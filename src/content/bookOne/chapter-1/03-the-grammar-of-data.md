# The Grammar of Data

> Data becomes knowledge only when language makes it visible.

## Prelude — Why Grammar Matters

Every language has grammar — rules that turn sound into sense.  
R, too, has grammar. But instead of words and verbs, its syntax shapes *data*.  
The **tidyverse** gives us a language that makes analysis *readable* and *expressive*.

Where base R often feels like an equation, the tidyverse feels like poetry:  
each function a phrase, each pipe a continuation of thought.

## Tidy Data — The Foundation

Before you can speak clearly, your sentences must be structured.  
In R, that means your data must be **tidy**:

- Each **variable** forms a column  
- Each **observation** forms a row  
- Each **value** lives in a single cell  

This idea, championed by Hadley Wickham, is deceptively simple — but it changes everything.

```r
library(tidyr)

messy <- data.frame(
  person = c("Alice", "Bob"),
  treatmentA = c(3, 6),
  treatmentB = c(5, 2)
)

tidy <- messy %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("treatment"),
               names_to = "treatment",
               values_to = "response")
tidy
```

Now your data *thinks in rows*, ready to be filtered, summarized, or visualized without confusion.

## The Grammar of Manipulation — dplyr

Once your data is tidy, you can begin to **speak**.  
`dplyr` gives you the verbs:

- `select()` — what matters  
- `filter()` — what qualifies  
- `mutate()` — what transforms  
- `summarise()` — what you want to learn  
- `arrange()` — how you want it ordered  

```r
library(dplyr)

tidy %>%
  group_by(treatment) %>%
  summarise(mean_response = mean(response))
```

Each verb is declarative — not “how to compute,” but “what I mean.”

## The Grammar of Visualization — ggplot2

If `dplyr` is the syntax of logic, `ggplot2` is the syntax of imagination.  
It’s based on the *Grammar of Graphics* — the idea that every plot is built from consistent components.

```r
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(tidy, aes(x = treatment, y = response, fill = person)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Response by Treatment", y = "Response Value")
```

This code reads like a sentence:  
*Take the data, map treatment to x, response to y, fill by person, draw columns, label clearly.*

Your plot isn’t a decoration — it’s the final clause in a well-formed paragraph of analysis.

## Reflection — Grammar Makes Thought Visible

R’s grammar isn’t just syntax — it’s philosophy.  
It teaches clarity through structure, and insight through fluency.  
When your code reads like your reasoning, your analysis stops being a tangle of operations and becomes a story.

### 🧩 Try This

Use `pivot_longer()` and `summarise()` to reshape and summarize your own dataset.  
Then visualize it with `ggplot2`.  
Ask: *What changed when I saw my data tidy?*

### 💭 Reflection

What does your data say, once it starts speaking a cleaner language?
