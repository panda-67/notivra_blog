# The R Mindset — Thinking in Data

Core idea: Before syntax, comes philosophy. You can’t master R by memorizing commands — you must learn to think the R way: vectorized, tidy, and analytical.

This chapter introduces R not as a language, but as a mode of reasoning for structured thinking about data.

A serial book on data analysis with R — methodical, practical, and deeply reasoned.
